		<p><strong>One Million Bones</strong> is a large-scale social arts practice, which means we use <a href="http://www.onemillionbones.org/students-rebuild/">education</a> and hands-on artmaking to raise awareness of genocides and atrocities going on around the world, this very day.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>We are collecting artwork bones for a collaborative installation of 1,000,000 bones on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. in the spring of 2013. This installation will serve as a collaborative site of conscience to remember victims and survivors, and as a visible petition to raise awareness of the issue and call upon our government to take much needed and long overdue action.</p>
		<p>We offer two ways to create a bone.&nbsp; You can sign-up to create your own bone(s) in the <a href="http://onemillionbones.squarespace.com/students-rebuild/">Students Rebuild challenge, A Path Forward</a>.&nbsp; Every bone created through this initiative generates a $1 donation, up to $500,000, to CARE for their work on the ground in Somalia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.&nbsp; These funds are generously donated by the Bezos Family Foundation.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>You may also have a bone made in your name for a donation of $5.&nbsp; These bones are either handmade of clay or will be made of biodegradable material.&nbsp; We will create the bone for you and place it in your honor on the National Mall.</p>
		<p>We never cease to be amazed at how many people have only the most vague notion of what genocide is, and how many more have no idea itâ€™s happening now.</p>
		<p>At One Million Bones we are committed to leveraging the power of art to inspire activism. As artists and activists ourselves, we feel the most powerful thing we can do to effect change is to use art as a means of introducing people to the issue and offering actions related to it.</p>
